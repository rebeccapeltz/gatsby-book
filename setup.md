## Create a free Cloudinary training account

You can create a new, free account on Cloudinary by adding +training to your
email when registering.  

Sign up [here](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free)

For example, I can create an account with this email:
`GMail-account+training@cloudinary.com`  

This is important, as we’ll be configuring settings and using Cloudinary add-ons.---

## Node/NPM

We’ll be coding in Node.js (v > 10.x), as well as creating some
HTML/JavaScript/CSS files.

Install the latest version of node/npm to follow along with node exercises.
[Download node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  
 

You can update node/npm with this command: `npm i npm@latest -g`

# IDE Visual Studio Code  

I’ll be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to serve HTML files on localhost.  

Another alternative to using the VS Code live server extension is to `npm i -g http-server` and open the server from the terminal with `npx http-server`.---

# Course Code Repository

The code repo is [here](https://github.com/cloudinary-training/cld-advanced-concepts) 

The easiest way to work with this repo is to download it. Most of the work will involve running local node.js scripts or serving from localhost.

This repo contains code and assets used during the exercises.  You'll find assets under the `assets` and `secure-assets` directories.  *The files can be served from `github.io`. This is useful when we’re working on modules like auto-upload/fetch. For example: 
https://cloudinary-training.github.io/cld-advanced-concepts/assets/images/cc0.png 

**(Optional)** If you want to serve your account repo on github.io, I recommend forking or
duplicating this repository into your own GitHub account. Forking allows you to pull from
upstream later if you want. Go to Settings and set up [gh pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) to serve the HTML files.

## .env
Your `.env` file is `.gitignored `and can’t be accidentally checked into a repository
because it will contain your `API_SECRET`.   

In the root of the project, you’ll find a `.env.template` file.
Copy it to an `.env` file and add your information: 
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```
This link will take you to the Console, where you can copy the Cloudinary 
URL into your buffer: https://www.cloudinary.com.

The .env file should contain the CLOUDINARY_URL and a USER_NAME which is the email you used to sign up for the account.

```bash
CLOUDINARY_URL=<cloudinary URL from console>
USER_NAME=<cloudinary account email>
```

## How to Run the node.js scripts 
See the .env.template for example of what is needed as described above.  Before running any scripts you need to run `npm install` in the terminal in the directory containing the package.json.  

You may want to run npm install in all the subdirectories prior to starting the
course. This can guarantee you are ready if you are accessing the course in a
network where npm install may be blocked.
These are the directories that contain a package.json and need the npm install:

1. signing-widgets/bonus  
2. signing-widgets/server  
3. user-upload-workflows/remote-functions  
4. video-player/vuejs  

All scripts (unless otherwise noted in a module) can be run from the root of the
project in the terminal.  

If I want to run a script in the /access-control directory to upload a private asset, I
can run it from the terminal like this from the root directory:
```bash
node access-control/private/upload-private.js
```

## Test your setup

Test that your environment variables are setup correctly:

```bash
node test-env.js
```

Test that you can upload assets:

```bash
node test-update.js
```

We use the JavaScript vue.js framework in the module on Video Player, as
questions come up about how to include widgets and player in frameworks. 
The code in the vue.js example is very similar to what you would use in a static
HTML page. The code for React and Angular is similar, but those frameworks
often require typescript, which can make the code more complex.  

To get the vue.js code running, you’ll need to install the Vue CLI, which will allow
you to start a local server to run the code.
Vue CLI Installation Instructions [here](https://cli.vuejs.org/)  

You will run `npm install -g @vue/cli`.

**Note:** You’re not installing Vue.js globally, just a package with the CLI

## CDN and Browser Caching 

In this course, we’ll be concerned about browser caching and CDN caching.
Understanding the flow of requests through the CDN and into Cloudinary’s system storage will help. It’s also helpful to be able to identify if you are caching in the CDN and to eliminate browser caching. 

You can use the [Cloudinary Debugger Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloudinary-debugger/ehnkhkglbafecknplfmjklnnjimokpkg?hl=en) to detect browser caching. 

![Cloudinary debugger](https://res.cloudinary.com/cloudinary-training/image/upload/book/setup-browser-caching.png)

To avoid browser caching, you can 
- check the disable cache and keeping the chrome inspector open,
- find an extension that prevents browser caching
- open your image requests incognito (Chrome) or private (Firefox)  

## Detect caching on Fastly


![Caching on Fastly](https://res.cloudinary.com/cloudinary-training/image/upload/v1588286105/book/setup-caching-fastly.png)

You can purge a fastly cache with this command:

```bash
curl -X PURGE https://www.example.com/image.jpg
```

## gh pages settings
In github.com settings:
-- Choose master branch for the source.
-- Click Enforce HTTPS if you have the option available.
You can also serve assets from the training github account: https://cloudinary-training.github.io/cld-advanced-concepts. 

![gh-pages](https://res.cloudinary.com/cloudinary-training/image/upload/book/setup-gh-pages.png)


## VS Code Node debug  

VS Code Node Debug: optional
Simple breakpoint debugging
-- Enable Debug > Node: Auto Attach
-- Set breakpoints
-- In terminal node --inspect `<filename>`

## Cleanup 

If you want to remove all assets from your cloud that were uploaded in this course,
you can find cleanup scripts in the `/utils` directory

## Chrome XHR Localhost bug (Adaptive Streaming)
There are some instances where serving from localhost will not work correctly
because XHR is used and there can be bugs around this, such as this one in
chrome:
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=67743
Links are provided to serve from the Advanced Concepts Server

## Using prettier in VS Code

This repo uses prettier for formatting.  If you're using Visual Studio Code you can add the prettier extension.  You can also rename the `.prettierrc.suggest` to the hidden file `.prettier` to use the rules followed in formatting the code in this repo.
Contents of `.prettier` below


```
{
  "singleQuote": true,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "semi": false,
  "arrowParens": "avoid",
  "space-before-function-paren": true
}
```
