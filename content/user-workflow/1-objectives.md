This is the beginning of three modules where use cases or requirements are presented and we see how to solve them through upload workflows.  The purpose of this module is help you see how to break down project requirements into solutions that take advantage of Cloudinary features and SDKs. In many cases there is more than one way to solve these problems.  Cloudinary also provides support for problem solving through the [Support Engineers](support@cloudinary.com), the Customer Success Managers, and the Solution Architects. 

In solving the real life problems in this module you'll be able to apply many of the concepts you've learned about in this course.
