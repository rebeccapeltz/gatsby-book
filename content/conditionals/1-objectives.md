Conditionals allow us to direct the use of transformations based on the results of logical expressions.

- Syntax of Conditionals for building logical expressions
- Identify Intrinsic Properties of Images and Video
- Logical Expressions use IF, IF/END and IF/ELSE/END
- Use Intrinsic properties of  Assets to make to make decisions about how to apply transforms
  - Width
  - Aspect Ratio
  - Tags
  - Context
  - Image Layers

In this module we'll look at how conditionals can help with these use cases: 

- “Debugging”: text overlay informs you of the result of your logical expression
- Responsive Images and Video: you need a portrait **aspect ratio** so test intrinsic width and aspect ratio
- Watermark: Apply video and text overlays to video base by testing a value in a **tag**
- Overlay Image based on **context** (metadata): value to apply overlay based on context value for asset license
- Overlay text and image based on **PSD** layer count
