## Upload

If you are using this module out of sequence, you'll need to upload assets for the exercise.  The video upload will upload 4 short videos used in the **video-player** module,  and the image upload uploads the files used in the **underlay-overlay** module.

### Upload Video

```bash
node video-player/upload-video-collection.js
```

### Upload Images

```bash
node overlay-underlay/upload-images.js
```
