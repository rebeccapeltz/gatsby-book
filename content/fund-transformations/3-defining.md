## Transformations

Media assets delivered to web pages must be able to adapt to different sized devices and browsers.  Devices come in different sizes and even though browser conform to standards, they don't serve all formats that are available.  We need to be able to provide assets that fit into responsive layouts.

Cloudinary solves the problem of changing asset dimension and format using transformations.  Transformations also allow us to add style to both images and video.

Using the Cloudinary servers and CDN infrastructure we can deliver on the fly transformations at any time with optimized caching.

For larger assets we can provide transformations that apply compression while maintaining quality.  If we have large videos we can use the eager transformations that we studied earlier to prepare them for delivery in different formats so that they can be served through different browsers.
