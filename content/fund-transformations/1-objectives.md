We've used the SDK to upload and manage assets.  This means we can create an organized and search-able media repository.  We can deliver assets to our users through a CDN so that geography and readiness are not a barrier to performance.  Now we're going to look at how we can manipulate the media assets themselves for purposes of optimization and aesthetics.

In this modules we'll be studying asset "Transformation" as we cover the following topics:


- URL Structure
- Defining "Transformation"
- Resizing
- Cropping
- Gravity
- Format
- Quality
- Aesthetics
