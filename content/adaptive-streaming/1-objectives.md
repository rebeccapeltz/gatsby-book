What is adaptive streaming? Why use it? How can you tell if a site is using it?  We'll get the answers in this module and see how to create a custom streaming profile with fallback so that it behaves optimally in all browsers.

We'll be using the Cloudinary Video Player to help serve videos with Streaming Profiles.


1. Upload a video so that uses adaptive bitrate streaming
2. Create and use Streaming Profiles 
3. Use Eager Transformation to apply Streaming Profile
4. Using the Video Player Widget: HLS, Dash, Fallback Examples
