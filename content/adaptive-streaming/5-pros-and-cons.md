Should we use adaptive streaming?

The criteria for making this decision are laid out in the table below.  If you are serving large video, you should use adaptive streaming to avoid buffering.  Large videos are those in excess of 60MB or > 30 seconds.  If you serving to mobile devices, an want good quality, you should consider using adaptive streaming.  If you are using a video player, this can enhance the service and make good service available for all browsers.

There is a cost to creating transformations for the different profiles you want to support, but it can be justified in the name of providing a quality video experience.
