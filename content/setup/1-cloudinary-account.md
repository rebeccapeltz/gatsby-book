## Create a free Cloudinary training account

You can create a new, free account on Cloudinary by adding +training to your
email when registering.  

Sign up [here](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free)

For example, I can create an account with this email:
`GMail-account+training@cloudinary.com`  

This is important, as weâ€™ll be configuring settings and using Cloudinary add-ons.
