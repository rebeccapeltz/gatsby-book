# Course Code Repository

The code repo is [here](https://github.com/cloudinary-training/cld-advanced-concepts) 

The easiest way to work with this repo is to download it. Most of the work will involve running local node.js scripts or serving from localhost.

This repo contains code and assets used during the exercises.  You'll find assets under the `assets` and `secure-assets` directories.  *The files can be served from `github.io`. This is useful when weâ€™re working on modules like auto-upload/fetch. For example: 
https://cloudinary-training.github.io/cld-advanced-concepts/assets/images/cc0.png 

**(Optional)** If you want to serve your account repo on github.io, I recommend forking or
duplicating this repository into your own GitHub account. Forking allows you to pull from
upstream later if you want. Go to Settings and set up [gh pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) to serve the HTML files.
