We use the JavaScript vue.js framework in the module on Video Player, as
questions come up about how to include widgets and player in frameworks. 
The code in the vue.js example is very similar to what you would use in a static
HTML page. The code for React and Angular is similar, but those frameworks
often require typescript, which can make the code more complex.  

To get the vue.js code running, you’ll need to install the Vue CLI, which will allow
you to start a local server to run the code.
Vue CLI Installation Instructions [here](https://cli.vuejs.org/)  

You will run `npm install -g @vue/cli`.

**Note:** You’re not installing Vue.js globally, just a package with the CLI
