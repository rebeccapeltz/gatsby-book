## Source of Truth

We've been configuring and using Fetch and Auto-Upload.  We noted some differences between the two.  The term "source of truth" describes one of the differences.  While both methods will upload to the Cloudinary database, and be served form the CDN, the Auto-Upload can represent source of truth in that it can maintain directory structure of the origin and it won't be cleared from the CDN.

Looking at the image below, we see that the Fetched imaged will always live in the root of the project, whereas the Auto-Uploaded image can live in a directory below the mapped directory corresponding to its location on the source server.  

Auto-Upload is often used for migration of assets onto Cloudinary.
